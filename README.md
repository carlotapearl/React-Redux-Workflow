# Activity: Redux Workflow - Round Table Discussion
# Understanding Redux Workflow  
## Professor Led Round Table Discussion  
Understanding workflow in Redux can be daunting at first. Implementing Redux takes practice and understanding the workflow is key.
In this roundtable discussion, discuss how actions, reducers and store are used to manage state in the Star Wars Explorer App. Focus on the People container. Discuss how the data is imported and set to state in the reducer. Discuss all other People related functionality, such as, actions (action type: SHOW_WORLD, function: homeWorld), setting state (stateExample) in a reducer, combining all reducers through the rootReducer, using the store and provider (index.js), and implementing all these in the People container and the View container.

## Your role as a student
Take an active role in the conversation. Round table discussions are an opportunity to follow up on confusing ideas, to ask questions and to promote ideas. Don’t be afraid to ask about concepts that elude your or to talk through your understanding of particular concepts. Many of your peers will likely also have areas of struggle. Contribute and help where you can, seek peer guidance and explanation where you can’t.
